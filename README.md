# Kubetest

`kubetest` is a tool for running tests against a Kubernetes YAML or JSON configuration file.
These tests can be used to enforce local or global best-practices, for example:

* Ensuring certain labels are set
* Prevent usage of images with the `latest` tag
* Prohibit privileged containers
* Enforce a naming convention for different resources

`kubetest` is currently alpha quality and undoutedly has a few issues. Things will change, hopefully for the better. Please open issues if you have feedback when trying it out.


## Writing tests

Tests are written in [Skylark](https://github.com/google/skylark), which is a small dialect of Python suitable for embedding in other programmes. This means you do not need an additional interpreter installed to run tests with `kubetest`. `kubetest` prioritises interopability over flexibility in this regard. Tests for Kubetest just require the `kubetest` binary to run. Let's take a look at an example test:

```python
#// vim: set ft=python:
def test_for_team_label():
    if spec["kind"] == "Deployment":
        labels = spec["spec"]["template"]["metadata"]["labels"]:
        assert_contains(labels, "team", "should indicate which team owns the deployment")

test_for_team_label()
```

Save the test file in a directory called `tests`, with a prefix of `.sky`. You can change the default directory name using the `--tests` flag. You can now run `kubetest` against your configuration files.

```bash
$ kubetest my-deployment.yaml
WARN my-deployment.yaml Deployment should have at least 4 replicas
$ echo $?
1
``` 

If any of the tests fail then `kubetest` will return a non-zero exit code.

By default `kubetest` outputs information about failing tests only, but you can pass `--verbose` to get information about passing tests as well.

```bash
$ kubetest rc.yaml --verbose 
INFO rc.yaml should not use latest images
WARN rc.yaml ReplicationController should have at least 4 replicas
```
  
## Installation

Tagged versions of `kubetest` are built by Travis and automatically
uploaded to GitHub. This means you should find `tar.gz` files under the
release tab. These should contain a single `kubetest` binary for platform
in the filename (ie. windows, linux, darwin). Either execute that binary
directly or place it on your path.

```
wget https://github.com/garethr/kubetest/releases/download/0.1.0/kubetest-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
tar xf kubetest-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
cp kubetest /usr/local/bin
```

Windows users can download tar or zip files from the releases tab.


## CLI

```
$ kubetest --help
Run tests against a Kubernetes YAML file

Usage:
  kubetest <file> [file...] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help           help for kubetest
      --json           Output results as JSON
  -t, --tests string   Test directory (default "tests")
      --verbose        Output passes as well as failures
```


## Thanks

A big thank you goes to the authors of [stretchr/testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/) from where much of the assertion code has been ported.
